# HelloTrello

Enables users of german keyboard layouts to access the trello searchbar using the hyphen key. If you do not use a german keyboard layout, you probably do not need this extension!

The reason for developing this addon is that trello users that use a german keyboard layout cannot use the original shortcut (which is the slash key).

This addon is pretty simple, but if you encounter any errors, feel free to tell me (or contribute to this project directly)!

You can download the addon via its [Firefox-Addons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hellotrello/).
